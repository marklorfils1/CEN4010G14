        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 
            My name is Ryan Kennon. I am currently a Junior at Florida Atlantic University majoring in computer engineering. I enjoy playing video games, fishing, and playing piano. I also recently started learning how to play guitar, and I have been enjoying it a lot. I feel that learning to play instruments has given me a greater appreciation for music.
        </p>
        <p>     
            I have found that what I've learned so far as a CE major has given me a better fundamental understanding of how different systems work. For example, what I've learned about electronics at FAU has given me a better understanding of how electric guitars, amplifiers, and various effects work. I often think about how certain features were programmed in software that I use, or what kinds of circuits are used in devices that I use.
